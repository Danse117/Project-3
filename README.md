# Naive Bayes Net Implmentation
(P3.py)
Project Goal: To build a classifier using the Naive Bayes model. The task is to predict whether a child will be recommended for a nursery. Predictions are made off of eight possible features which all cases have.

## The label and each feature can take the following values:
-	Nursery admission recommendation (L): { recommend, not-recom}
-	Parents occupation (O): {usual, pretentious, great_pret}
-	Childs Nursery (N): {proper, less_proper, improper, critical, very_crit}
-	Family form (F): {complete, completed, incomplete, foster}
-	Number of children (C): {1, 2, 3, more}
-	Housing (H): {convenient, less_conv, critical}
-	Finance (I): {convenient, inconv}
-	Social (S): {non-prob, slightly_prob, problematic}
-	Health (A): {recommended, priority, not_recom}
